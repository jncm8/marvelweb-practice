# marvelweb-practice
Hello, this is my first public repo on GitHub. 
I am still learning web development and am currently dipping my toes into publishing websites using github in order to test out how it would look on other browsers.
I chose marvel because I am a comic book fan and thought I would enjoy the time finding material to use as content to test out my website-building skills.
